# SPEC
Set up PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) Edge Camera (SPEC)


## Description
The SPEC is a fully contained and continuous Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) calculation system. Once a user sets it up on a riverbank, SPEC will aquire images at a user specified rate and use them to perform PIV calculations. SPEC is also set up to be customized by the user depending on the river. A web-application stored on SPEC and accessed by connecting to SPECâ€™s Wi-Fi access point allows easy setup and customization on site 

This repository includes the code for system configuration and calibration, image capture, image processing and undistorting, homography, and PIV analysis for a field site. The results of the pipeline are 2D velocity vector fields, represented in a plot overlaid on the measurement area.

## Build/Installation
All materials and diagrams needed to build a SPEC camera system are located in the [Setup folder](Setup/) of this repository's directory, including all necessary documentation. 

## Usage
SPEC was developed to be a bank-mounted camera system to measure river surface velocities. The system is a completely self-contained data collection and processing unit. We designed this system with citizen science in mind, keeping the cost of materials low and all 3D-printed models and code are available open source.

Citizen science was also a priority when planning the deployment process in the field. A user just needs a SPEC system and a place to mount it. Then using the web-application a user can customize the parameters used during the PIV calculations for the current river conditions.

More information can be found in the [Docs folder](Docs/) of this repository.

## Authors and acknowledgement
SPEC was a research and development project engineered by Deep Analytics LLC. Funding for this project was provided through the USGS Next Generation Water Observing System (NGWOS) Research and Development program.

This PIV algorithm of this project was ported from TRiVIA:
- Legleiter, C.J., 2024, TRiVIA - Toolbox for River Velocimetry using Images from Aircraft (ver. 2.1.3, September, 2024): U.S. Geological software release, 
    https://doi.org/10.5066/P9AD3VT3.

Contribution and Modification of original SPEC code with the USGS FLOW (Future Leaders in Water Observation) Academy [Son Do, Bhanu Poudyal, and Kylie Corcoran] for the following:
- Timestamps included in test_PIV.sh and ensemble_PIV.py
- Automatic PIV output uploader, lte_upload.py. Script must be manually run to enable.
- Lengthening of 3D-printed sled mesh to allow for easier access to PI's SD card port.
